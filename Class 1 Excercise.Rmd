```{r}
firstvar
```
##Create and store a character vector (of your choice), 
a numeric vector (interger/double) and a factor, all of the same length

```{r}
Salesregions <- c("NA","Europe","Asia Pacific")
Sales <-c(200,300,400.0)
length (Salesregions)
length (Sales)

```
2. Use `seq()` to generate an atomic vector containing all the odd numbers less than 100
```{r}
seq(from = 99, to = 1, by = -2.0)
```

3. Store all the vectors created in step 1 in a named list
```{r}
testlist <- list(Salesregions,Sales)
testlist
```

4. Create a dataframe using all the vectors stored in step 1
```{r}
regionaldata <- data.frame(Region = Salesregions, SalesAmount = Sales)
regionaldata

```

regionaldata <- data.frame(Region = Salesregions, Sales Amount = sales)

5. Predict the output of the following without running the code in 
`+ c("FALSE", FALSE)`- "Character",
`+ c(1.0, FALSE)- "Double"`, `
 + c(2, TRUE)- "Double", 
`+c("two", 2)- "character"`

6. What get returned when you check the `typeof()` the dataframe created in step 4. Why?

```{r}
typeof(regionaldata)

```




This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
